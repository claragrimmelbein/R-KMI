This is a simple test for a different pseudodata generated with a different model that we called 'basic'. Here I am just doing an old KMI (previously called LMI) using only the first 5 sets. Separately I am also doing a local fit for the first 5 sets and comparing the results.
The final result for the first 5 sets is shown in figure cffs_vs_t_sets_1to5.png
I did not posted the .keras resulting model files for each replica but let me know if you need them.
